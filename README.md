Running the demo
----------------
Build the project then kick off the process. An initial form will show for first name, last name, 
flyer status {None, Bronze, Silver, Gold}, Country Code, Zip if in US and number of bags lost.  

If in US, will pass in zip code to zip code web service. Only the following zip codes will return 
states. Any other zip will return Texas.

	  //Park Ridge, IL
		zipCodes.put("60068", "IL");
		
		//Honolulu, HI
		zipCodes.put("96801", "HI");
		
		//New York, NY
		zipCodes.put("10001", "NY");
		
		//Bethel, AK
		zipCodes.put("99559", "AK");

After zip code service is called, the state field on passenger is used in web decision table to 
determine the cost of shipping.  Next, a DSL is used to figure out a surcharge for AK and HI.  

If not in US, county code is looked up in spreadsheet decision table and sets shipping and surcharge.

Finally, DSL is used to apply a promotion of free shipping and surcharge if passenger is of status Gold. 
You are then shown the route the process took and the variables to confirm shipping and surcharges are correct.

See support directory for included spreadsheet decision table ( NonUSShippingCost.xls) and docs directory for 
an overview presentation of the project.
