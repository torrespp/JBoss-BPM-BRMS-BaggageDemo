This directory is for putting your projects source code into. The install script 
will then be pointed here to do any builds, copy of built source binaries to an 
installed product server, etc.

Most often in JBoss demo projects, the web applications, web services, and other
client jars will be created here in a maven project. After building the JAR / WAR
would be copied into the JBoss application server.
